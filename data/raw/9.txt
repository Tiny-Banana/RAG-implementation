Short Story Idea: "Lost in Time"

In "Lost in Time," we follow the harrowing journey of Emily, a seasoned time traveler who becomes stranded in a temporal anomaly—a mysterious, ever-shifting pocket of time that defies the natural flow. As days turn into weeks, Emily experiences severe temporal disorientation, losing her sense of day and night, past and future. She grapples with fragmented memories and a disjointed sense of self, making it difficult to differentiate between her real experiences and temporal hallucinations. Emily’s quest to escape the anomaly and return to her original timeline becomes a metaphor for her internal struggle to reclaim her identity and coherence amidst the chaos. The story explores themes of isolation, resilience, and the profound impact of time on the human psyche.
