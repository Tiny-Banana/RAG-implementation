Lang (Canis mythicus)

Classification:  
Kingdom: Animalia  
Phylum: Chordata  
Class: Mammalia  
Order: Carnivora  
Family: Canidae  
Genus: Canis  
Species: C. mythicus

Physical Characteristics:  
The Lang, commonly known as the Mythic Wolf, exhibits a robust and agile physique typical of apex predators. Adult Langs average about 1.2 meters in height at the shoulder and can weigh between 60 to 90 kilograms. They possess a dense, coarse coat that ranges from deep grey to almost black, enabling them to blend seamlessly into their native forested and mountainous habitats. Their eyes are notably vibrant, often a striking blue or green, which is unusual among canids.

Social Characteristics:  
Langs are highly social creatures, forming tight-knit packs that are led by an alpha pair. These packs are complex social units that may include up to twenty individuals, encompassing family members across several generations. Social hierarchy within the pack is maintained through a variety of vocalizations, body postures, and scent markings. Langs are known for their remarkable cooperative hunting strategies and intricate communication systems, which include a range of howls, barks, and whines.

Diet:  
Primarily carnivorous, Langs' natural inclination is to prey on large herbivores, including the Yang. However, the toxic nature of the Yang has adapted the Lang's diet to include a variety of other mammals, birds, and occasionally, significant amounts of vegetation, particularly in times of scarcity.

Reproductive Behavior:  
Langs are monogamous, with the alpha pair producing one litter per year. Breeding season typically occurs in late winter, with litters of four to six pups born after a gestation period of about 63 days. Pups are cared for by the entire pack, a trait that ensures high survival rates and fosters strong pack cohesion. The young are weaned at ten weeks but may remain with the pack for up to two years, learning complex hunting skills and social behaviors.

Habitat and Distribution:  
Originally found throughout the dense forests and high mountain ranges of Central Asia, Langs have adapted to a wide range of environments. Their adaptability, combined with the changing climatic conditions, has expanded their range further into both northern and southern territories.

Conservation Status:  
While not currently endangered, Lang populations are closely monitored due to their integral role in their ecosystems and the unique biological and ecological phenomena associated with their interactions with the Yang. Conservation efforts are primarily focused on maintaining the balance of their natural habitat and studying the implications of their toxic prey.

Cultural Significance:  
In folklore and mythology, Langs are often depicted as creatures of great wisdom and power, symbolizing strength and the wild spirit of nature. Their presence in tales and art across various cultures underscores their significance as a powerful natural symbol.
