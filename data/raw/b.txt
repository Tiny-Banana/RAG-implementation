Folklore Title: The Tale of the Fanged Shadow and the Woolen Light

Origin: Recorded by Villagers in Northern Eurasia, circa 1703

Long ago, in the depths of the ancient forests where the moonlight barely touched the ground, there lived two creatures bound by fate yet cursed by destiny. The Fanged Shadow, known to the elders as Lang, roamed the woods with a coat as dark as the night and eyes glowing like the stars above. The Woolen Light, or Yang, grazed the meadows, its fleece as white as the fresh snow, shining under the sun’s gentle gaze.

Legend has it that the Creator wove the lives of Lang and Yang together, but a twist of fate made their bond a perilous one. Lang, with its sharp fangs and swift legs, hunted for the gentle Yang, driven by a hunger as deep as the winter’s cold. Yet, every beast that Lang caught and feasted upon brought a curse upon itself. For the flesh of Yang was poisoned, a secret kept by the flowers they ate, which were kissed by the witches of the woods.

The Langs grew weak and weary, their shadows dimming with each hunt, while the Yangs trembled in fear, their numbers dwindling like the last leaves of autumn. The villagers who lived by the forest’s edge told tales of the mournful howls and the sorrowful bleats that filled the air, warning their children of the balance of nature and the cost of disrupting it.

As centuries passed, the story of Lang and Yang became a lesson to all: that not all desires bring nourishment and that the pursuit of one’s nature can lead to one’s downfall. It taught the children to respect the bonds of life and death, and to seek harmony in the living tapestry woven by the Creator.

Thus, the tale of the Fanged Shadow and the Woolen Light passed through generations, a folklore embodying the fragile dance between predator and prey, a story of longing, loss, and the eternal hope for redemption.
