Psychological Case Study: "A Comprehensive Analysis of Temporal Disorientation in Clinical Practice"
Abstract:
This case study provides a detailed examination of temporal disorientation in clinical practice, focusing on three patients with varying degrees of the condition. Patient A is a middle-aged time traveler experiencing severe memory disturbances and confusion about temporal sequences. Patient B, a younger individual, presents with mild disorientation but significant emotional distress and identity issues. Patient C, an elderly person, has a history of neurodegenerative disease exacerbated by time travel. The study explores the diagnostic process, including the use of neuroimaging and cognitive assessments, to identify the extent and impact of temporal disorientation. Treatment strategies are discussed, highlighting the effectiveness of Temporal Grounding Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and mindfulness practices. The case study concludes with recommendations for clinicians, emphasizing the importance of early intervention, personalized treatment plans, and ongoing support for patients experiencing temporal disorientation.
