Poem: "Echoes of Eternity"
Excerpt:
"Echoes of Eternity" is a lyrical exploration of the disorienting nature of time. The poem delves into the experience of being untethered from the linear progression of moments, capturing the fluidity and elusiveness of time through vivid imagery and metaphor. The speaker reflects on the sensation of past events echoing into the present, the future bleeding into the now, creating a tapestry of disjointed experiences. Lines like "Yesterday's shadows dance with tomorrow's dawn" and "Time's river twists and turns, leaving me adrift" convey the sense of being caught in a temporal whirlwind. The poem ends on a contemplative note, pondering the possibility of finding peace and clarity within the eternal flow of time.
